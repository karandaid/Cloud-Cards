1. Amazon EC2 => Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud

2. Amazon EC2 presents a true virtual computing environment, allowing organizations to launch compute resources with a variety of operating systems, load them with custom applications, and manage network access permissions while maintaining complete control. 

3. Amazon EC2 allows organizations to obtain and configure virtual servers in Amazon’s data centers and to harness those resources to build and host software systems. Organizations can select from a variety of operating systems and resource configurations (memory, CPU, storage, and so on).

4. Amazon EC2 allows you to acquire compute through the launching of virtual servers called instances. There are two concepts that are key to launching instances on AWS:
    (1) the amount of virtual hardware dedicated to the instance and
    (2) the software loaded on the instance.
These two dimensions of new instances are controlled, respectively, by the instance type and the AMI. 

5. There are dozens of instance types available, varying in the following dimensions:
    a) Virtual CPUs (vCPUs)
    b) Memory
    c) Storage (size and type)
    d) Network performance 

6. Instance Type Families 
    a) c4: Compute optimized For workloads requiring significant processing
    b) r3: Memory optimized For memory-intensive workloads
    c) i2: Storage optimized For workloads requiring high amounts of fast SSD storage
    d) g2: GPU-based instances Intended for graphics and general-purpose GPU compute workloads 

7. The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) defines the initial software that will be on an instance when it is launched. An AMI includes the following:
    a) A template for the root volume for the instance (for example, an operating system, an application server, and applications)
    b) Launch permissions that control which AWS accounts can use the AMI to launch instances
    c) A block device mapping that specifies the volumes to attach to the instance when it's launched

8. There are several ways that an instance may be addressed over the web upon creation: 
    a) Public Domain Name System (DNS) Name 
    b) Public IP 
    c) Elastic IP 

9. AWS stores the public key, and the private key is kept by the customer. The private key is essential to acquiring secure access to an instance for the first time. 

10. AWS allows you to control traffic in and out of your instances through virtual firewalls called security groups.

11. Security groups allow you to control traffic based on port, protocol, and source/destination. 

12. Type of Security Group 
    a) EC2-Classic Security Groups: Control outgoing instance traffic
    b) VPC Security Groups:         Control outgoing and incoming instance traffic 

13. Every instance must have at least one security group but can have more. 

==================
 VM Import/Export
==================
14. You can only export previously imported Amazon EC2 instances. Instances launched within AWS from AMIs cannot be exported. 

15. VM Import/Export enables you to easily import virtual machine images from your existing environment to Amazon EC2 instances and export them back to your on-premises environment.

16. VM Import/Export is available at no additional charge beyond standard usage charges for Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3.

=================
 Pricing Options
=================
27. Pricing Options
    a) On-Demand Instances: Pay, by the second, for the instances that you launch.
    b) Reserved Instances: Purchase, at a significant discount, instances that are always available, for a term from one to three years.
        1) All upfront
        2) Partial upfront
        3) No upfront
    c) Spot Instances: Request unused EC2 instances, which can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly.
    d) Scheduled Instances: Purchase instances that are always available on the specified recurring schedule, for a one-year term.
    e) Dedicated Hosts: Pay for a physical host that is fully dedicated to running your instances, and bring your existing per-socket, per-core, or per-VM software licenses to reduce costs.
    f) Dedicated Instances: Pay, by the hour, for instances that run on single-tenant hardware.
    g) Capacity Reservations: Reserve capacity for your EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone for any duration.

28. You can modify your whole reservation, or just a subset, in one or more of the following ways:
    a) Switch Availability Zones within the same region.
    b) Change between EC2-VPC and EC2-Classic.
    c) Change the instance type within the same instance family (Linux instances only). 

29. Spot instances are recommended for:
    a) Applications that have flexible start and end times
    b) Applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices
    c) Users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity

30. On-Demand instances are recommended for:
    a) Users that prefer the low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2 without any up-front payment or long-term commitment
    b) Applications with short-term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted
    c) Applications being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first time

31. Reserved Instances are recommended for:
    a) Applications with steady state usage
    b) Applications that may require reserved capacity
    c) Customers that can commit to using EC2 over a 1 or 3 year term to reduce their total computing costs

==================
 Tenancy Options
==================
32. AWS Tenancy Options
    a) Shared: default tenancy model for all Amazon EC2 instances, regardless of instance type, pricing model, and so forth.
    b) Dedicated Instance Run on hardware that’s dedicated to a single customer. As a customer runs more Dedicated Instances, more underlying hardware may be dedicated to their account. 
    c) Dedicated Hosts: An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is a physical server with Amazon EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to a single customer’s use.

33. Dedicated Instances:
    a) Enables the use of dedicated physical servers
    b) Per instance billing (subject to a $2 per region fee)
    c) Automatic instance placement

34. Dedicated Hosts
    a) Enables the use of dedicated physical servers
    b) Per host billing
    c) Visibility of sockets, cores, host ID
    d) Affinity between a host and instance
    e) Targeted instance placement
    f) Automatic instance placement
    g) Add capacity using an allocation request
