1. A placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone. 

2. You can launch or start instances in a placement group, which determines how instances are placed on underlying hardware.

3. When you create a placement group, you specify one of the following strategies for the group:
    a) Cluster: clusters instances into a low-latency group in a single Availability Zone
    b) Partition: spreads instances across logical partitions, ensuring that instances in one partition do not share underlying hardware with instances in other partitions
    c) Spread: spreads instances across underlying hardware

4. The name you specify for a placement group must be unique within your AWS account for the Region.

5. You can't merge placement groups.

6. An instance can be launched in one placement group at a time; it cannot span multiple placement groups.

7. Reserved Instances provide a capacity reservation for EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone. The capacity reservation can be used by instances in a placement group. However, it is not possible to explicitly reserve capacity for a placement group.

8. Instances with a tenancy of host cannot be launched in placement groups.

9. For instances that are enabled for enhanced networking, traffic between instances within the same Region that is addressed using IPv4 or IPv6 addresses can use up to 5 Gbps for single-flow traffic and up to 25 Gbps for multi-flow traffic. A flow represents a single, point-to-point network connection.
